## About

Hashicorp Vault Kubernetes deployment based on the official Hashicorp Vault HELM chart. (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/helm)

I re-wrote the official Hashicorp HELM chart to narrow the deployment scope and simplify the HELM code. The current HELM chart implementation depends on the GCP Terraform code and is not designed as a stand-alone unit.
